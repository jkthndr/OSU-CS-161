# Description: Working through the examples on the OSU CS 161 course


# Exercises
# 1. Write a statement that prints out a float value of 290.73

# print(float(290.73))

# 2. Write a statement that prints out the string value "He replied, "Never mind", and shut the door."

# print("He replied, \"Never mind\", and shut the door.\n")

# 3. Write a statement that prints out the bool value True (not the stirng value "True")

# print(True)

# 4. Write a statement that prints out the result of using the type command on the value 99

# print(type(99))

# 5. Write a statement that prints out the type of the value "What is your quest?"

# print(type("What is your quest?"))

# Working through the exercises
# print("Here is a backslash: \\")
# print(False)
# print(True)

# Exploration: Variables & Assignment

# myValue = 999
# print("The type of myValue is ", type(myValue))
# myValue = "I am the very model of a modern major general."
# print("The type of myValue is ", type(myValue))

# Exercises

# 1. Assign the value 3.14159 to a variable named pi, and then print out the value of that variable

# pi = 3.14159
# print(pi)

# 2. Assign the value "Smith" to a variable named last_name, and then print out the value of that variable

# last_name = "Smith"
# print(last_name)

# 3. Assign the value 19.3 to a variable named length_in_inches, and then print out the type of the value that variables refers to
# length_in_inches = 19.3
# print(type(length_in_inches))

# 4. Assign the value "haberdashery" to a variable named occupation, and then print out the type of the value that variable refers to.

# occupation = "haberdashery"
# print(type(occupation))

# # Exploration: Comments, Arithmetic & String Concatenation
#
# # 1. Write a statement that prints out the remainder of 19 divided by 6
#
# print(19 % 6)
#
# # 2. Write a statement that prints out 2 to the 4th power
#
# print(2**4)
#
# # 3. Write a statement that finds the result of 9 divided by 5 and assigns it to a variable named conversion_ratio
#
# conversion_ratio = (9/5)
# print(conversion_ratio)
#
# # 4. Write code that first assigns 9 to a variable called num_planets, then substracts 1 from it, so that num_planets will now equal 8.
#
# num_planets = 9
# num_planets -= 1
# print(num_planets)
#
# # 5. Write code that assigns "Doctor" to a variable named title, assigns "Pierce" to a variable called last_name, and then uses string concatentation to print out "Doctor Pierce".
#
# title = "Doctor"
# last_name1 = "Pierce"
# print(title, last_name1)

# Exploration: Input & Casting

# print("Please enter your name")
# name = input()
# print("Hi", name)

# name = input("Please enter your name: ")
# print("Hello,", name)

# Exercises

# 1. Write code that asks the user for their name and then prints out "Hello" folowed by their name.None

# name = input("PLease enter your name: ")
# print("Hello", name)

# 2. Write code that asks the user for two numers and then prints out "The result is" folllowed by the result of multiplying those numbers.

# num_1 = input("Enter your first number: ")
# num_2 = input("Enter your second number: ")
# print("The result is", int(num_1) + int(num_2))

# 3. Sames as #2, but first store the result of multiplication and then use that variable when printing out the result.

# num_1 = input("Enter your first number: ")
# num_2 = input("Enter your second number: ")
# print("The result is", int(num_1) * int(num_2))

# Exploration: Example Error Messages
# num_1 = input("Enter first operand: ")
# num_2 = input("Enter second operand: ")
# print("The result is", int(num_1) + int(num_2))
